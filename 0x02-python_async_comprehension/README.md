## Introduction

In Python, async comprehensions and asynchronous generators are powerful features for working with asynchronous operations and constructing sequences of data. This project provides examples and explanations for these concepts.

## Asynchronous Generators

An asynchronous generator is a special type of generator that yields values asynchronously. It allows you to yield values lazily and asynchronously using `yield` and `await` within an `async def` function.

### Example:

```
async def async_generator():
    for i in range(3):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an asynchronous operation
        yield i
```

## Async Comprehensions

Async comprehensions are used to construct asynchronous sequences, like lists, sets, or dictionaries, by applying an async expression to each item in an iterable.

### Example:

```
import asyncio

async def async_comprehension_example():
    async with asyncio.open_file('data.txt', 'r') as file:
        async for line in file:
            words = [word async for word in line.split() if 'a' in word]
            yield words
```

## Type-Annotating Generators

You can type-annotate generators using the `Generator` type hint from the `typing` module. This provides clarity and correctness in your code.

### Example:

```
from typing import Generator

def integer_generator() -> Generator[int, None, None]:
    i = 0
    while i < 5:
        yield i
        i += 1
```

## Usage Examples
